Reasons why MPU6050 might not give out readings.

1. connections might be loose/ not firmly connected, or no proper pull up resistors added as per requirements.
2. Check and provide proper voltage to the sensor, adding proper decoupling capacitor accordingly, check if all the necessary common grounds are connected.
3. If the clock signals are out of range that the MPU6050 can support. 
4. The I2C scanning is not done properly, check the code, wrong address or wrong device on the I2C bus is scanned.
5. Check if MPU6050 is not under High powered electromagnetic fields, extreme temperatures, short circuits nearby or in the circuits.
6. Check if the signals from the master are proper according, by probing the osscilloscope and seeing triggers.
7. check if the mcu is busy doing other tasks when mpu6050 is sending the data. To properly test this making sure that no other code is running. 
8. The pins of the board might have been exposed to high volage/ reverse voltage , short circuit or ESD on the pins by poor ESD protections etc.
9. wiring and distance from the mpu6050 to the mcu should not be greater than the specified standards of the I2C on the circuit. 
10. re Check if the mcu io is capable of of I2C on some other device, or check with some other port pins.
